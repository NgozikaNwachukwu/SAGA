# SAGA: Your Texting-Style AI Study Buddy

A CS Girlies Hackathon Project

SAGA is an AI-powered learning companion designed to make studying feel like texting your smartest, kindest friend. No dashboards. No clutter. No overwhelming explanations. Just simple, human language that meets you where you are.

Type in anything you’re stuck on — recursion, Big-O, inflation, pointers, literally anything — and SAGA breaks it down into clean, friendly explanations you actually understand. You can ask follow-ups, request examples, or switch to a more “tutor” or “pro” tone if you need deeper detail.

SAGA was built by two women in software engineering who understand what it feels like to struggle silently through confusing topics. We wanted a tool that *gets us*, talks like us, and makes learning less intimidating and more conversational.


 What SAGA Does

- Explains any topic in clear, beginner-friendly language
- Adapts its tone: friendly, tutor, or pro
- Let’s you ask follow-ups like:

- “explain simpler”
- “Give an example.”
- “go deeper”
- Provides starter prompts when you don’t know where to begin
- Saves context so the conversation stays natural
- Works like a clean iMessage-style chat, not a complicated tool

SAGA focuses on clarity, confidence, and approachability. It’s learning, but without the pressure.



Why We Built It

We noticed that most learning tools feel either too robotic or too overwhelming.
But everyone knows how to text.

So we asked ourselves:
“What if learning felt like texting a friend who actually explains things well?”

That became SAGA.
A simple chat interface powered by AI, designed especially with women and femme CS students in mind, because representation matters and clarity shouldn’t be a luxury.


Tech Stack

- Frontend: React (Vite), custom chat UI, CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- AI: OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini)
- Communication: REST API
- Version Control: Git + GitHub

We intentionally kept the stack lightweight.


Features We’re Proud Of:

- Clean, modern chat bubbles with smooth scrolling
- Three different explanation tones
- Smart follow-up actions that feel intuitive
- A backend that strips messy markdown and formats AI responses beautifully
- A UI that works exactly like a conversation, not a lecture


What’s Next

SAGA was built in under 48 hours, so there’s a lot more we want to add:

* Visual diagrams for harder topics
* “Girlified mode” with analogies from beauty, fashion, and everyday life
* Personalized learning paths based on what you ask
* Voice explanations
* Dark mode (will be implemented soon)
* More models and providers
